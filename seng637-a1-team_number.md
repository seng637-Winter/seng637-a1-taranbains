# Introduction

This assignment focuses on two different software methodologies: Exploratory and Manual Testing. Exploratory testing focuses on designing test cases as a tester is actively testing the application. They are learning the software as they are writing test cases, and adapting the test cases based on what they find. Manual testing refers to manually executing a set of already thought-out/designed test cases, without using automation tools, ie. a person still needs to execute the test cases. 


# High-level Description of the Exploratory Testing Plan

The team initially set out to understand the application's behaviour by following the instructions under the "Familiarization with the ATM System". This will also allow the team to discover any critical defects or issues that would cause the entire application to crash. After following the set instructions, the team can explore specific features and functionalities of the application and taking notes on the output versus what they expect the output to be. Most common functions/paths are tested extensively to ensure the applictaion works as expected in most cases, while also testing a few more less common paths. The focus is on testing the features used the most by the user.  Any deviations or defects found were then recorded in Jira issue tracking system. 
 
The following two types of testing should be conducted:    
**Integration Testing:** individual software functions are combined and tested as a group.  
**System Testing:** the entire complete, integrated application will be tested.  

The scope of testing is presented in the table below:    

**Table 1:** Scope of testing
| Module	| Description | Test Logistics
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Turn ATM On/Off  | Operator can turn the ATM application on and off.  | Taran Bains
| Inserting Card  | User can insert a valid or invalid card and pin number, with appropriate responses.  | Satchy Karalasingham
| Withdrawal  | User can withdraw money from an account of their choosing.  | Balkarn Gill
| Deposit  | User can deposit money in an account of their choosing.  |Chioma Ukaegbu
| Money Transfer  | User can transfer money between accounts.  | Hannah D'Souza
| Balance Inquiry   | User can get an accurate balance of an account of their choosing.  | Taran Bains

# Comparison of Exploratory and Manual Functional Testing

Exploratory testing offers adaptability and can uncover subtle, complex bugs through tester intuition and real-time investigation. It's especially useful in early development stages but may lack thorough coverage and test repeatability. For exmaple, a tester may not be able to accurately reproduce a bug that caused the system to crash that they found through a very convoluted route. Conversely, manual functional testing provides systematic coverage and repeatability, ensuring each application aspect functions as expected. While it excels in verification against established requirements, it may miss issues outside predefined test cases and can be resource-heavy due to test maintenance.

Effectiveness-wise, exploratory testing is superior for identifying new issues especially with a tester experineced in the application, whereas manual testing reliably checks for conformity to known expectations. Exploratory testing is quick to adapt and offers immediate feedback, but manual testing is time-efficient over multiple test cycles.

In practice, a balanced approach that utilizes both methods can maximize the benefits, with exploratory testing for ongoing learning and discovery, and manual testing for consistent validation and regression testing. The integration of both approaches caters to comprehensive quality assurance needs within a project's lifecycle.


# Notes and Discussion of the Peer Reviews of Defect Reports

# How the Pair Testing was Managed and Teamwork/Effort was Divided 

The team was initially divided into two for the exploratory testing, to help the team members individually understand the application and the features/functionality. Then the team members went through the Test Cases outlined in Appendix C, discussed if the applications output should be expected or not, and added bugs that the team agreed on to the Jira board.
The team then divided up the bugs found in V1.0 to test the V1.0 application and record if bugs were resolved or still in progress.


# Difficulties Encountered, Challenges Overcome, and Lessons Learned

There was a challenge in figuring out what exactly the application was supposed to do. Sometimes you would test a functionality during exploratory testing and get a result that seemed suspicious, but you were not 100% sure that it was an actual error. That would require a little more discussion amongst the team to figure out if other team members thought it was a bug or the system was supposed to do that. The manual scripted testing made it a little easier with having a description of what the expected outcome was supposed to be following the given steps. 
The instructions for the assignment were a bit confusing due to the length, otherwise the lab was interesting and useful once we made sense of the instructions.
